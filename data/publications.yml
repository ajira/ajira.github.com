- title: "F# Applied 2"
  description: "The objective of this book is to answer the most significant question that developers encounter while learning or working with F#:

                How can I build a real-world, production-ready, end-to-end application in F# using the functional programming principles?
                Immutability, Type Safety, Pattern Matching, Pure Functions and all other functional programming things sound good on paper but How can I build something useful by applying it?
                This book has been created exclusively to answer these questions in a developer-friendly way!
                We are going to build a clone of the Twitter application, FsTweet. Right from starting an empty directory for the application to deploying it on Azure App Service, we are going to learn step by step"
