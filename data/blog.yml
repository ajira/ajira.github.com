- title: Managing Data in Golang Using Gorm - Part 1
  description: We have been using gorm as a primary tool to interact with PostgreSQL from golang for almost a year now. Gorm does an excellent job as an ORM library, and we enjoyed using it in our projects. Through this blog post series, I will be sharing our experiences on how we leveraged gorm to solve our client’s needs

- title: Leveraging Interfaces in Golang - Part 1
  description: In my previous blog post on using golang in production, I have mentioned that interfaces are my favorite feature in golang. As a follow-up of this comment, I would like to share how we are using (my current project is also in golang!) the interfaces to keep our code clean and consistent through a series of three blog posts. This blog post series assumes that you are familiar with the basics of interfaces in golang. If would like to know what it brings to the table, I strongly recommend to check out this well-written article by Yan Cui. Let me start the series with a solution that we have implemented a few days back

- title: Using GoLang in production My Experiences
  description: For the last one year, I was working with the development team of a leading media entertainment company in India and developed a cloud platform to distribute the DCPs across the globe in a uniform, scalable and cost-effective manner. We built the entire platform using golang and event-driven microservices architecture. It was an exciting journey, and this blog post summarizes my experiences of using golang in this project.

- title: Leveraging Property Based Testing
  description: Property-based testing is one of the powerful technique to unit test the code. Unlike the example-based testing (where we Arrange a set of example inputs to Assert the system under test), Property based testing enable us to focus on what we wanted to test and liberate us from doing mundane work on coming up with sample inputs. Recently, I got a chance to use Property based testing in an open source library that I am developing to use Suave in Azure Functions. I felt very productive and it was a such a joy to write the unit tests. In this blog post, you are going to learn how Property-based testing has helped me and why you need to consider using(or learning) it
