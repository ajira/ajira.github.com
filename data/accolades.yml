  text: Ajira Software developed  a customized solution  for our company from an early stage of concept to full development on time and on budget.  After considering different software developers in Europe and India, I chose Ajira and could not be more satisfied with the outcome. We are  in fact embarking on our second project now. What gave Ajira the ability to perform at such a  high level was their commitment, skills and expertise to not only understand our requirement but also to recommend improvements as we went through the development process. This was an impressively collaborative process. The result is a software tool that is as effective, and more comprehensive, as originally planned
